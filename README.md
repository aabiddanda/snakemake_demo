## Snakemake Demo (PopGen Edition)

The primary purposes of this repository are to get accustomed to using snakemake in a new cluster environment with configurations. This is primarily for my own personal use.

For running on a [`slurm`](https://www.schedmd.com/) cluster, I would highly recommend using this  [`snakemake` profile](https://github.com/jdblischak/smk-simple-slurm).
